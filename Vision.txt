The three main inputs to the CookIt
1) Chop It 
	- 5 times?
	- Physical implementation: will have 2 contacts on the table, and will use a metal knife to "chop" and complete the circuit

2) Cook it
	- Physical implementation: have to turn a dial (either rotarty encoder or potentiometer) to represent turning up heat

3) Plate it
	- Physical implementation: Have to put "ingredients on plate"
		- Each ingredient will be a PCB
		- There will be a general PCB design for genertic “ingredient” with Pins
		- Solder resistor onto PCB for each individual ingredient
		- List of ingredients
			- top bun (use digital pin to determine when connected
			- bottom bun (permanently on plate)
			- *lettuce*
			- *cheese*
			- *onion*
			- *tomatoes*
			- *patty*
			* = need adc port
